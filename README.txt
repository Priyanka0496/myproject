Description :   

   The code is basically divided into five files. main.c, matrix.c, trigo.c, conv.c and xyz.h which contains all the prototypes. Matrix.c file contains all the operations related to the matrix like addition, subtraction, multiplication, determinant, symmetry and more. While trigonometric file contains trigonometric functions like cosine, sine, their hyperbolic and inverse. While main.c contain all the normal, basic arithmatic functions. It also contains programme to find roots of qaudratic equations and finding squreroot. main.c also contains functions on polynomials like addition of polynomial. For this functions, to represent polynomial, I have used linked list. coefficients and powers of components are stored in linked list. conv.c file contains the convrsion functions like binary conversion, hexadecimal conversion and octal conversion.
